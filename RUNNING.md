# Running More Firepower

Rebuilt baseline (see `dev-log.md` for the slice-by-slice history).

## Tests

```bash
npm test              # full suite, all milestones + baseline self-tests
node --test test/milestone2f.test.js   # single milestone
```

## Play in a browser

```bash
npm install
npm start             # http://localhost:8080 — join an active war
```

Environment: `PORT` (default 8080), `MAP_SEED` (default 2026).
Open two browser windows and join opposite teams for a local skirmish.
Controls: pick team → "Next asset" to take an asset → click ground to move,
click a visible enemy to fire. Return to base to resupply.

## Headless sims

```bash
npm run sim1f         # terrain speed demo
npm run sim1g         # combat duel demo
npm run sim2a         # full integration soak (scripted operators + replay check)
npm run simv1         # 32-participant war: 16 scripted humans + 16 AI regents
```

## LAN play (2+ humans)

```bash
npm start                              # host machine
# other players browse to http://<host-lan-ip>:8080
```

- Pick a team on the join screen; "Next asset" cycles free assets, or click
  a free friendly unit to take it.
- **The objective**: steal the enemy Command Standard (cone marker in their
  base) and carry it into your command zone while your own standard sits at
  home. First capture wins; the war then rotates automatically (~30s
  scoreboard, fresh map seed, everyone keeps their seat).
- Click semantics: free friendly unit = select · visible enemy = fire ·
  friendly wreck = tow (get adjacent first) · ground = move.
- Camera: WASD/arrows pan, wheel zooms, F re-follows your unit, Home jumps
  to your zone, X jumps to the enemy standard, minimap click jumps anywhere.
- Supply: relays project supply — out-of-supply units crawl at half speed
  and cannot fire. Idle in your base to resupply ammo/fuel; guns have per-
  chassis reload (tank 15 / scout 8 / artillery 40 ticks).
- Wrecks are rescueable: tow them to your base, 10s repair, back at half hull.
- Your browser keeps a persistent player id: closing the tab hands your asset
  to AI regency, reopening reattaches you to the same operator slot.
- Difficulty: `AI_DIFFICULTY=0|1|2 npm start` (easy/normal/hard).
- Ops endpoints: `GET /health`, `GET /metrics` (balance instrumentation),
  `GET /replays`, `GET /replay/:id`.
- Ctrl-C shuts down gracefully (clients warned, war archived).

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t more-firepower .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e MAP_SEED=2026 more-firepower
```
