## marker-0001 — Baseline: green suite at milestone 0→1F (2026-07-25)

**Goal:** reconstruct a green 1E+1F baseline in `./` (49/49 tests).

**Finding:** the root tree was a chimera. `engine/server.js`, `transport.js`,
`ai_regency.js`, `snapshot.js`, `clock.js`, `commands.js`, `session.js`,
`frontier_corridor.js` were genuine 1E-era implementations, but
`shared/canonical.js`, `shared/prng.js`, `shared/fixedmath.js`,
`engine/state.js`, `engine/reducer.js`, `engine/view.js`, `engine/mapgen.js`
had been clobbered by the standalone 1F drop-in package (float math in the
reducer, a non-byte "byte writer", drifted mix32 constants). The original 1E
implementations exist nowhere in `phases/` — only their tests and byte-exact
fixtures survive. Those fixtures were used as the reconstruction spec.

**Reconstructed (fixture-verified against original pins):**
- `shared/canonical.js` — true LE byte writer (fixture 0A), FNV-1a 64 via
  16-bit limb math, no BigInt (fixture 0B), `hashToHex64`.
- `shared/prng.js` — mix32 per the algorithm documented in fixture 0C;
  `seedSfc32(seed) = {a..d} = mix32(seed+1..4)`; standard sfc32 step
  (fixture 0D incl. sequence hashes). Root's mix32 had drifted constants.
- `shared/fixedmath.js` — added `floorDivI32`, `absI32`, `cellToWorld`,
  `worldToCellFloor`, `manhattanDistanceI32` (fixture 0E). Kept `clampI32`,
  `mulFixed`, `divFixed`.
- `engine/state.js` — full 1E schema: 32 operators (16..23 = AI regency),
  8 field assets (team A cell x=7, team B x=117, rows 56/58/60/62), teamScores,
  events. Map-profile registry (`frontier_corridor`) or sandbox map object.
- `engine/reducer.js` — pure `apply(state, command)`: join/select/move/advance
  with the original event shapes incl. `rejected` events (from 1A fixture);
  integer axis-major movement, BASE_SPEED 16, 1F terrain multipliers merged in.
- `engine/view.js` — per-team fog views: `friendlyAssets`, `visibleEnemies`
  (Chebyshev radius 12 cells, minimal enemy record), `events`, `mapCells`.
- `engine/mapgen.js` — parametric generator honoring the 0F structural
  contract (road spine, protected 2x2 bases, dims 4..256).

**Fixtures:** 0I (frontier corridor 128x128) and 0A–0E pass against their
ORIGINAL pins — proof the reconstruction matches the lost originals.
Regenerated (originals unrecoverable, provenance noted in each file):
- `0F_map_8x8.json` → fixtureVersion 2 (lost mapgen algorithm; structural
  invariants still enforced by the test).
- `1A_reducer.json` → fixtureVersion 2 (hashes only; the 14-step command
  script, event payloads, ticks, and rejection cases reproduced VERBATIM by
  the reconstructed reducer before re-pinning).

**Tests rewritten (per decision: tests follow source):**
- `test/milestone1f.test.js` + `test/headless/sim1f.js` — ported from the
  standalone 1F package API to the merged engine (`advance_tick`, full asset
  schema, team-based views). Intent preserved.

**Added:** `test/baseline.test.js` — 17 self-tests: shared-layer edge cases,
rejection paths, asset handover/release, exact-arrival movement, fog boundary
at radius 12 vs 13, enemy-record minimality (no hp/target leak), 300-tick AI
determinism, human+AI interleaved reproducibility, no-eviction guarantee.

**Removed:** `shared/types.js`, `engine/ai.js` (unused stubs with conflicting
constants; recoverable via git).

**Result:** `npm test` 49/49. `node test/headless/sim1f.js` runs.

## marker-0002 — Slice 1G: combat, HP depletion, disablement (2026-07-25)

**Policy decision (applies to every slice from here):** the phase-folder code
for 1G+ descends from the degraded standalone-1F fork (`'tick'` commands,
fire-by-assetId with no operator authority, no events, no fog). Slices are
therefore re-implemented on the reconstructed authoritative engine: each
slice's game-design content (mechanics, rules, pinned constants, acceptance
criteria) is kept; its code is treated as reference only; its tests are ported
to the command-authority flow.

**Added:**
- `engine/combat.js` — `resolveShot` (pinned 20 hp/shot), `inFireRange`
  (1280 fixed units = 5 cells, integer squared distance), `DEFAULT_RULES`.
- `fire_order` command (`commands.js` validation + reducer handler):
  operator must be active and own an operable asset; target must exist, be
  hostile and operable, and be in range. Emits `fire_resolved` (+
  `asset_disabled` at hp 0); every rejection emits a `rejected` event with a
  specific reason. Disablement stops mid-move assets.
- `test/milestone1g.test.js` — all 7 plan acceptance criteria + 3 self-tests
  (disable-while-moving, refire-at-disabled rejected, overkill floors at 0).
- `test/headless/sim1g.js` + `sim1g` npm script.

**Result:** `npm test` 59/59.

## marker-0003 — Slice 1H: fog LOS + suppression visibility (2026-07-25)

**Added:** `engine/los.js` (`computeVisible(state, team)`, `sensorRadius`,
radii 12 / 6-when-suppressed); `view.js` now delegates visibility to it.
Suppression implemented as `suppressedTimer` on assets (30 ticks, set by a
non-lethal hit, decremented each advance_tick) — deliberately NOT an asset
state, since it must coexist with IDLE/MOVING; plan's `ASSET_SUPPRESSED`
constant replaced by `isSuppressed(asset)` helper (deviation logged).
Wrecks (disabled/salvaged) are always visible and never act as sensors.

**Schema:** `suppressedTimer` added to asset hash (snapshot.js + 1A test
hash fn); `1A_reducer.json` → fixtureVersion 3 (hashes only, events verbatim).

**Tests:** `milestone1h.test.js` — 6 plan criteria + 3 self-tests (suppress →
recover cycle, no timer on wrecks, wrecked sensors blind). 68/68 green.
